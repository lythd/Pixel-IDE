Current tasks on my mind:
Make the tree have the ability to hide restricted nodes such as settings.pxset files.
Make find and replace tool.
Parse function in Parser, returns a list of CodeObjects which themselves are lists of CodeSubObjects. Except for CodeBracketArea which returns a list of CodeInstructions (on the Level of CodeObjects).
Shortcuts like ctrl + s, ctrl + o, ctrl f.
Add better exporting in the tree.
.pxl (Pixel library archive which is like .pxe but all the .pxc files are unexported .pixel files still). Library’s for exporting to the different format things, export 
library runnable theme and error. Include java less versions on website next to the corresponding java version. Aswell as javascript versions.
package.pxs and project.pxs files to denote that the parent folder is a project or package.
hide .pxs files
make console a jscrollpane with a jtextfield so it can print multiple lines and you can't type in it.
PixelEvent system, this handles errors,warnings,no file in editor etc.
The PRE and PVM (runtime environment and virtual machine) are both coded in low level languages. Either c or something similar.
